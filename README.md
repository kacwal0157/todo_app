# ToDo App

## The project written in Flutter using DART showing todo notes made by user.

This project was created as a recruitment task. It contains all good programing standards like DRY 
(don't repeat yourself) or class single responsibility. The API is responsible for:

* List all user todo notes
* Have possibility to add, remove, edit and mark note as important or favourite
* If user does not have any notes it shows proper message
* Validate all notes if they meet all requirements 

## How to use this API

The easiest way to see how it works is to open up android or iOS emulator and run the application. Follow the steps below to run the app:

1. Download any time of emulator - I highly recommend Android Studio to download and manage it.
2. Open the project in your IDE (for example Visual Studio Code)
3. Run the emulator by clicking on bottom right side of IDE and make as active device your emulator
4. Next step is to run the app by clicking on 'debug and run' in top right corner or enter in terminal 'flutter run'
